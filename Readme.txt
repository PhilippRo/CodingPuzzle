				 =============

Given a string comprising just of the characters (,),{,},[,] determine if it is
well-formed or not by applying the following rules:

- Each type of bracket needs to be first opened then closed
- You can only close the last bracket that was
- Inside parenthesis () only Braces {} are allowed
- Inside Braces {} only Square brackets [] are allowed
- Any bracket can appear inside square brackets []

For a given string print out True if the string is well-formed or False if
otherwise.
